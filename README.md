# GANS-on-random-data
In this project I studied whether GANS can be used to generate non image data and markov chains.

GANS have extensively been used in the generation of images. They can mimic the original dataset.
But in this project I studied whether GANs can be used to generate random sequences with a certain probability distributions.
This could be useful as it can have many applications like:
- It can be used to generate financial time series data
- It can be used in the generation of musical sequences.
AND MANY MORE APPLICATIONs.......
